Quotes by Eleanor Roosevelt

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.
You must do the things you think you cannot do.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
Women are like teabags. You dont know how strong they are until you put them in hot water.
The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.
Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.
