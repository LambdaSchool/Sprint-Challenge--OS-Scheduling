1. Name at least three things that a general-purpose operating system is responsible for handling.

- The OS manages and allocates memory.
- The OS manages scheduling.
- The OS also manages I/O.

 2. Describe the job of the Scheduler in the OS in general.
   
- The OS uses a scheduler to manage all the proccesses on a system. The scheduler can give priority to the proccesses thus controling when processes run.

 3. Describe the benefits of the MLFQ over a plain Round-Robin scheduler.

- Round-Robin scheduler doesn't priorty which means every process has equal priorty. Processes that are more important to the user are not treated as such by the scheduler. MLFQ on the other hand learns from past behaviour to predict the processes that should have higher priority.
